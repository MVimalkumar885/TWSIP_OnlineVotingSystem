Overview

OnlineVotingSystem is a Java-based desktop application that allows users to cast their votes electronically.

- Candidate selection with four options (Candidate A, B, C, and D)
- Vote casting and submission
- Display of voting results

Concepts Used

- Java Swing for GUI development
- Event-driven programming for handling user interactions
- HashMap for storing and retrieving vote data
- Enumerations for candidate options
